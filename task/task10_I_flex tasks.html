            BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[39] Its motorcycle brand
            is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the
            "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[40] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a
            cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models
            (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s.
            Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.

            The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

            During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a motor-driven sidecar attached,
            combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road.[41][42]

            In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in
            a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series
            with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.

            In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the
            oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased
            capacity to 1,170 cc (71 cu in) and enhanced performance to 75 kW (101 hp) for the R1200GS, compared to 63
            kW (84 hp) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the
            R1100S and R1200S, producing 73 and 91 kW (98 and 122 hp), respectively.

            In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine
            producing 125 kW (168 hp), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than
            previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a
            Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

            BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of
            anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of
            electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

            BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before
            most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to
            1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging
            fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front
            suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly
            reduces dive under braking.[citation needed]

            BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna Motorcycles for an
            undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by
            Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

            In September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the
            technology to help improve road safety.[43] The design of the bike was inspired by the company's BMW R1200
            GS model.[44]F
